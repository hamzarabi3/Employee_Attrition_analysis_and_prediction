# classification-with-imbalanced-data
This notebook builds a deep learning model to predict employee attrition.
The first part is an exploratory data analysis, where I analyse the factors that are most responsible for employees leaving a company. 
In the second part I use keras to build a binary classifier and try different workarounds to solve class imbalance problem. 
You can run this notebook in colab, simply add the datafile to your directory and change it int the pd.read_csv cell
