# classification-with-imbalanced-data
This notebook builds a deep learning model to predict employee attrition.
The first part is an exploratory data analysis, where I analyse the factors that are most responsible for employees leaving a company. 
In the second part I use keras to build a binary classifier and try different workarounds to solve class imbalance problem. 
<h> You can run this notebook in colab, simply add the datafile to your directory and change it int the pd.read_csv cell<\h>
